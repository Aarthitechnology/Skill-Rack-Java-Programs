/*There are N people in a Facebook group. The group follows the following three rules.
1) The group leader does not follow anyone.
2) Everyone in the group follows the group leader.
3) No more than one group leader is allowed
The N people are numbered from 1 to N. The program must accept the integer N and R relationships. Each relationship contains two integers representing who follows whom. The program must print an integer denoting the group leader. If the group leader can not be found, the program must print -1 as
the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= R <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N and R separated by a space.
The next R lines, each containing 2 integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer denoting the group leader or -1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 7
1 3
2 3
3 4
5 3
1 4
2 4
5 4

Output:
4
Explanation:
Here the group leader is 4 as everyone follows 4 in the group and the 4 has not followed anyone.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5 9
1 2
2 4
3 4
1 5
1 4
3 2
5 4
2 5
4 2

Output:
-1
